The Department of Humanities, in conjunction with The Humanities Research Group, is pleased to announce a virtual symposium on the topic of “Society and the Arts in the Pandemic”, on Friday 30th April, 2021. 

This symposium welcomes contributions from across the arts and social sciences exploring the intersections between the arts and society during periods of pandemic. On the one hand, people turn to the arts during periods of crisis as a means of escapism. Writers and artists across time have vividly intervened to document, critique and console. On the other hand, economic and political expedients can leave artists adrift during periods of pandemic, with cultural venues closed and access to their audiences limited. This is in spite of the fact that arts and art therapies can play a significant role in addressing some of the negative consequences of social isolation and anxiety. 

We welcome abstracts (500 words) addressing any aspect of the intersections between society and the art during the current or previous periods of pandemic. Symposium papers should be 15 minutes in length and will be delivered virtually. 

Abstracts as well as a short biographical note should be emailed to aoileann.nieigeartaigh@dkit.ie by Friday 26th March 2021.
